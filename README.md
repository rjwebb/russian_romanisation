Script to transliterate text in Russian to Latin

I wrote this because I wanted to read an old Russian encyclopedia that I found at home but since I don't know how to read Cyrillic characters this was pretty tough going. I hate having to rote memorise scripts so being able to compare the original text and its transliteration side by side seemed like a good approach. It turns out that there are in fact a bunch of ways of doing that so I wrote this script.

`russian_romanisation.csv` is adapted from the transliteration table in the Wikpedia article for "[Romanization of Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian#Transliteration_table)". The code currently only swaps the Russian characters for the transliterated strings - it does not implement any of the rules specified in the Table Notes. I should probably go back and implement those at some point.
